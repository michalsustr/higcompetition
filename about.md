Progress in AI is best benchmarked by letting agents compete with each other.
The [Annual Computer Poker Competition
(ACPC)](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/) was a powerful force for
developing algorithms that can play Poker at a super human level.

In a spirit similar to ACPC, we'd like to organize a competition to test agents
on large challenging games outside of Poker. We are specifically interested in
large two-player zero-sum imperfect information games, which have some
interesting and non-trivial structure of imperfect information.

In some sense, large perfect-information games have been solved by the learning
algorithm [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815). As one of the primary
goals of this competition we'd like to achieve a similar status for two-player
zero-sum imperfect-information games: the same algorithm should be able to play
any large game.
