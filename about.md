Progress in AI is best benchmarked by letting agents compete with each other.
The [Annual Computer Poker Competition
(ACPC)](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/) was a powerful force for
developing algorithms that can play Poker at a super human level.

During (2006 - 2018) ACPC greatly pushed algorithms for imperfect information
games:

- [CFR (2007)](http://martin.zinkevich.org/publications/regretpoker.pdf)
- [Solving limit Texas Hold’em Poker (2015)](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/publications/2015-ijcai-cfrplus.pdf)
- Finally, sound search methods (2017): we have computers bots that bested
  humans in no-limit Texas Hold’em Poker: [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai/)
  and [Libratus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/papers/17-IJCAI-Libratus.pdf).

ACPC significantly boosted research of imperfect information games, but ACPC is
now dead. What games could now push the research forward?

In a spirit similar to ACPC, we'd like to organize a competition to test agents
on large challenging games outside of Poker. We are specifically interested in
large two-player zero-sum imperfect information games, which have some
interesting and non-trivial structure of imperfect information.

### Guiding principles

- Move the science of imperfect information games forward.
- Use multiple games to drive generality.
- Community driven.
- Academy oriented.
- Have fun!

### What we hope for

In some sense, large perfect-information games have been solved by the learning
algorithm [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815). As one of the primary
goals of this competition we'd like to achieve a similar status for two-player
zero-sum imperfect-information games: the same algorithm should be able to play
any large game.

### Committee

All decisions are agreed upon within organizing committee. The committee members are:

- Martin Schmid (DeepMind)
- Noam Brown (Facebook)
- Viliam Lisý (CTU)
- Michal Šustr (CTU)
